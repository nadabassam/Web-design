                <p class="Content-item-desc">
                    The rapid technological development, particularly in the area of information and communication
                    technology,
                    has led to the wide application and proliferation of computerized systems. Given the importance of
                    information and the urgent
                    need to keep it from being hacked for the purpose of change or theft, one of themost important and
                    necessary science in this
                    area has emerged:
                    <br> information security science, which protects information from the risks it
                    poses or the barrier to attack
                    it by providing the tools and means to provide it.<br>
                    Standards and measures taken to prevent access to information by unauthorized persons<br>through
                    communications and to ensure
                    the authenticity and validity of such communications.<br><br>

                    That is why there is an urgent need in our various institutions that use modern technology,
                    computerized systems and local
                    and global information networks for information security engineers to design, oversee and implement
                    information systems
                    security systems in a highly efficient, successful and inexpensive manner.
